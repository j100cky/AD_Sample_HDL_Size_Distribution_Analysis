# AD_Sample_HDL_Size_Distribution_Analysis

This project analyse the HDL particle size distribution in the AD project. 

HDL particle size data are obtained by using the FIJI image processing software on electron microscope image of HDL samples, with customized ijm scripting.

Size data are analyzed using the RStudio software. 

Analyses that are planned. 
1) Abundance of particles at different HDL size range (NMR size ranges) compared among genotypes (ApoE3E3 and E3E4). 
2) Abundance of particles at different HDL size range (NMR size ranges) compared among the three diagnostic groups (AD, MCI, Control).
3) Clustering of RMSD value among all subjects. 
4) Explaining the clustering of RMSD (if any) by different variables (genotype, diagnostic group, age, sex, BMI, diabetes, etc.)
