[**Name14 (STitle) 80462**] is an 87 yo male admitted to [**Location (un) 5871**] on [**7-23**] for\\nsevere pneumonia. He was sent home on antiobitics but\\nre-presented five days later with increasing SOB, productive\\ncough, and confusion. At that time, he underwent bronchoscopy\\nwhich showed LLL secretions and TBM. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 112**]\\nfor stent was placed by thoracic surgery. He was then discharged\\nto rehab on vancomycin/cipro. He developed acute respiratory\\nfailure at rehab on day 10 of antibiotic courserequiring\\nintubation prior to EMT arrival. Initial ABG noted to be\\n7.10/101/103/31. She was then trasnfered to [**Hospital1 80463**].\\n.\\nAt [**Hospital6 **], he was remained intubated for\\napproximately one day and initially required levophed to\\nmaintain BP. Sputum cultures on admission were positive for\\nMRSA, so he was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo. He was hydrated\\nwith fluids and his pre-renal ARF resolved. He was extubated\\nprior to [**8-26**]. He was tolerating bipap for 2 days but required\\nre-intubation today for unclear reasons. He was found to have a\\nnew LLL pneumonia. He underwent another bronch on [**8-28**], where\\nhis stent was found to have migrated distally. He was started on\\nlevophed drip.\\n.\\nAn echo on [**8-27**] showed elevated PA pressures ( 49-54) though\\nunchanged from previous echo). PA pressure on [**8-16**] was noted to\\nbe 52.1. He was started empirically on heparin on [**8-27**] but this\\nwas held prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] at 11:30 Am for unclear\\nreasons. Of note, patient failed bedside swallow eval on [**8-26**].\\n.\\nHe is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stent removal and Y-stent\\nplacement following recovery of pneumonia.\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History:\\nHTN\\nElevated creatinine (baseline 1 - 1.2)\\nH/o Diverticulosis\\nGERD\\nChronic anemia\\n\\n\\nSocial History:\\nRetired architect.

Sputum cultures\\nfrom OSH positive only for MRSA.  Patient intially treated with\\nVanco/Zosyn, but this was switched to vanco/cefepime due to\\nconcern for eosinophilia.  Patient went to OR for stent removal\\non [**8-28**], which revealed a distally migrated stent that\\nobstructed the left mainstem bronchus, followed by successful\\nY-stent placement by interventional pulmonary on [**8-30**]. He was\\nsuccessfully extubated that afternoon and was called out to the\\nmedical floor on [**9-6**]. Noted to have increasing lethargy with\\ntachypnea to 30-40s, O2 sats dropping to 83% on RA that night\\nand retransferred back to MICU where large amounts of tan\\nsecretions and mucous plugs were immediately suctioned out with\\nimprovement in both the patient's mental status and respiratory\\nstatus. He was rebronched with removal of thick mucous and again\\nwas transferred back to the medical floor on [**9-9**]. He did well\\nfrom a respiratory standpoint and was about to be transferred to\\npulmonary rehab when he again had another episode of tachypnea\\nto the 30-40s, hypoxia to mid 80s, tachycardia to 130s, and\\nlethargy which prompted retransfer back to MICU. Once again, he\\nwas deep suctioned with removal of large amounts of thick, tan\\nsecretions. At this time, he was also noted to have a\\ntemperature to 101.2F. He was rebronched and BAL culture\\nrevealed > 100K MRSA in the sputum. He was placed back on IV\\nvancomycin for treatment of MRSA PNA. Aggressive, standing\\npulmonary toileting with chest PT q4h, deep suctioning q4h,\\nacetylcysteine and albuterol nebs q4h, ipratropium nebs q4h,\\nalbuterol nebs q2h prn, and guaifensisn was initiated with good\\nresult. The patient's O2 requiement was weaned down to 2.5 L NC.\\nHe was again trasnferred out to the medical floor on [**9-15**] and\\nplaced on the above pulmonary toileting regimen. He was also\\ncontinued on IV vancomycin, with the dose adjusted for a\\nvancomycin trough goal of 15-20 for a total of another 2 weeks.\\nPICC placed for IV abx administration. O2 sats mid 90s on 2-3L\\nNC at the time of discharge.\\n.\\n2) Hypotension - Patient was initially hypotensive, requiring\\nlevophed on presentation.  He was found to have low CVP of 2 and\\nimproved with IVF boluses.  He was quickly weaned off levophed.\\nHe was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia as\\nabove and had no positive blood cultures. No further episodes of\\nhypotension at the time of discharge.\\n.\\n3) Delirium - Hospital course complicated by waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]\\nmental status consistent with delirium [**1-13**] prolonged ICU and\\nhospital admission. The patient required intermittent prn doses\\nof zyprexa while in the MICU for agitation and sundowning. On\\nthe medical floor, he required frequent reorientation and was\\ncontinued on prn zyprexa and haldol. Briefly required 1:1 sitter\\nas attempting to get OOB without assistance. Benzodiazepenes and\\nanti-cholinergics were avoided. Foley was d/c'd but\\nunfortunately had to be replaced for failure to void and 1000\\nccs in bladder. Foley d/c with void trial will need to be\\nattempted again at LTAC.\\n.\\n4) Chronic renal insufficiency - Baseline Cr 1.0 - 1.2. Meds\\nwere renally dosed.\\n.\\n5) Eosinophilia - Patient had eosinophilia on admission to OSH.\\nHe was on vanco/levaquin/zosyn. He did not develop a drug rash,\\nbut due to persistent eosinphilia, he was switched to\\nvanco/cefepime with improvement of eosinophilia.\\n.\\n6) Nutrition - Followed by speech and swallow consult in the\\nhospital out of concern for aspiration due to mental status and\\npoor cough reflex. He was briefly kept NPO while in the ICU\\ngiven concern for aspiration and Dobhoff tubes were placed;\\nhowever, were d/c'd by the patient within 24 hours. Thus, tube\\nfeeds were never able to be titrated up to goal. Upon transfer\\nout of the ICU, the patient was again reevaluated by speech and\\nswallow who cleared the patient for a soft solids, thin liquid\\ndiet.

He\\nwas ultimately intubated and then 20-30 min later developed PEA.\\nThere was a question of difficultly placing the LMA. The patient\\nreceived chest compressions but no defibrillation. In addition,\\nhe was given epinephrine and atrophine. His heart rate and BP\\nimproved. It was then decided, that since he had stabalized, to\\ncontinue with the wash-out. Gross pus was drained from his wrist\\nand a wick left in place. In the PACU, he then became hypoxic\\nand bradycardic once again, code blue was called. His blood\\npressure and HR recovered with an epinephrine and phenylephrine\\ndrip. Per the plastics attending a quick echo in the OR, showed\\nbiventricular dysfunction. An EKG was performed post-op with ST\\nchanges that were unchanged from prior. He received dilauded in\\nthe PACU for pain. He received Midazolam, vecuronium,\\nsevoflurane, esmolol, metoprolol, ephedrine, epinephrine,\\natropine, phenelephrine and propofol by anesthesia in the OR. He\\nwas transferred to the MICU following the arrest. He was closely\\nmonitored on telemetry for two weeks following the PEA arrest\\nwith no further concerning events prior to discharge.\\n\\n# Stroke:\\nAfter transfer out of the MICU, patient was noted to have\\ndifficulty with visual acuity as well as short term memory\\ndeficit and confusion about events surrounding hospitalization.\\nOn [**6-4**] an MRI was obtained and showed concern for acute left\\nocciptal lobe and left basal ganglia infarct. Neurology was\\nconsulted and followed case throughout hospital course. Carotid\\ndopplers on [**6-5**] revealed a 80-99% stenosis of left ICA.\\n[**Month/Year (2) **] surgery was consulted and recommended outpatient\\nfollow-up. TEE was obtained on [**6-6**] and showed no concern for\\nvalvular vegetations. Repeat MRI on [**6-11**] showed concern for new\\nright frontal lobe infarct. LUE ultrasound was obtained on [**6-12**]\\nand was negative for AV fistula thrombus. As patient was\\nclinically improving from standpoint of memory and subjective\\nvisual acuity, further work-up of acute stroke was deffered to\\noutpatient setting. Patient will be maintained on aspirin and\\nclopidogrel as he was previously taking. He has a follow-up\\nappointment with [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery on [**2193-7-23**], at this time\\nthey may choose to address the left ICA stenosis.\\n\\n# Lower extremity weakness:\\nToward end of hospitalization patient began to complain of lower\\nextremity weakness. Neuro exam of lower extremities revealed\\nsymmetric 5/5 strength. Despite this, given his history of\\nbacteremia, a CT lumbar spine was obtained on night of [**2193-6-14**]\\nto attempt to rule out a spinal epidural abscess. At time of\\ndischarge preliminary read of CT was that there was no evidence\\nof spinal process to explain patient's subjective LE weakness.\\nSense of weakness likley related to prolonged hospitalization\\ncausing deconditioning. Likely to benefit from physical therapy\\nand occupational therapy following discharge.\\n\\n# CK elevation:\\nLabs just after PEA arrest with CK 74. This rose to 385 nine\\nhours later. Several hours later his CK then peaked at [**Numeric Identifier 24799**].\\nHis troponin was also positive immediately post PEA arrest,\\npeaking at 0.8, but MBI remained low at 0.2. It was thought that\\nthe troponin elevation was due to CPR but could also represent\\ncardiac ischemia. The patient was intially seen by cardiology\\nwho did not think he had had a primary cardiac event. ECHO did\\nshow biventricular depressed EF, new from prior. However, his CK\\nwere disproportionately elevated relative to troponin. He was\\nevaluated for muscular causes of elevation: No sign of\\ncompartment syndrome. No neuroleptics or SSRI's given;\\nanesthesia did not think anesthetics would have caused this.\\nRhabdo for inactivity was unlikely as pt was actually agitiated\\nand moving around frequently. There was no documented seizure\\nactivity in the OR. His CK elevation was eventually was solely\\nattributed to hypotension in setting of PEA arrest on [**2193-5-29**].\\nHis CK trended down to 127 on [**2193-6-15**], the morning of\\ndischarge.\\n\\n# Septic arthritis:\\nHand surgery saw the pt in the ED but was unable to aspirate any\\nfluid on a tap. He was placed on Vancomycin. Originally,\\nplastics felt that the joint was unlikely to be infected;\\nhowever, as his pain escalated, he was taken to the OR for a\\nwash-out on [**2193-5-29**]. In the OR, he had PEA arrest during\\nanesthesia induction (see above). Intra-op wound culture\\nreturned as pasteurella (levofloxacin sensitive). Later, blood\\nculture from [**5-29**] returned as containing pasteurella (also\\nlevofloxacin sensitive). Due to patient's penicillin allergy, he\\nwas initially on aztreonam for the gram negative bacteremia;\\nhowever, when final sensitivities revealed levofloxacin\\nsensitivity, the patient was switched to levofloxacin. He had a\\nleukocytosis up to WBC count of 32K; however, this trended down\\nseveral days after initiation of levofloxacin therapy. Patient's\\nfinal recommended antibiotic course is to receive Vancomycin IV\\nas well as Moxifloxacin IV until follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic on\\n[**2193-7-11**]. Further decision about total antibiotic course will\\nbe made at this ID follow-up appointment. Patient should receive\\nongoing betadine soaks of left wrist as well as wet to dry gauze\\n[**Year (4 digits) **] to left wrist three times daily until further\\nrecommendations to be made in follow-up with plastic surgery had\\nclinic within 2-4 weeks following discharge from the hospital.\\n\\n# Yeast bacteremia:\\nGrew 1/2 bottles yeast through a-line on [**2193-5-30**] that later\\nspeciated as [**Female First Name (un) **] parapsilosis. He was initially started on\\nMicafungin upon receiving positive culture result; however, was\\nswitched to fluconazole upon learning that the yeast was [**Female First Name (un) **]\\nparapsilosis. Transthoracic ECHO (TTE) a day after PEA arrest\\nshowed no vegetations. TTE was repeated on [**2193-6-3**] with note\\nof globally reduced LV systolic function with depressed EF to\\n20%. Again, no vegetations were noted. After new stroke was\\nnoted on MRI imaging on [**6-4**], concern was again raised for\\n[**Female First Name (un) **] endocarditis and a transesophageal ECHO was performed on\\n[**6-6**] and noted no vegetations on aortic or mitral valve. LVEF\\nwas still depressed to ~20% at that time. Thoughout\\nhospitalization, surveillance blood cultures were drawn and\\nfollowing the [**2193-5-30**] culture positive for [**Female First Name (un) **], there were\\n14 negative blood cultures drawn up until time of discharge.\\nPatient is scheduled to complete course of fluconazole (200 mg\\nIV Q48H) on [**2193-6-22**].\\n\\n# Visual changes:\\nPatient complained of some blurry vision and poor visual acuity\\nfollowing transfer out of the MICU. Patient had ophthalmologic\\nevaluation to rule out candidal endophthalmitis and was found to\\nhave no concern for endophthalmitis; however, poor visual\\nacutity and diabetic proliferative changes were noted. MRI on\\n[**6-4**] noted a left occiptal lobe stroke. Was recommended that he\\nfollow-up in ophthalmology clinic following discharge for visual\\nfield testing s/p occipital lobe stroke as well managment of\\ndiabetic retinopathy.\\n\\n# Sacral hematoma:\\nIn the MICU, the patient c/o exquisite pain to sacrum and was\\nunable to lie on his back. General surgery was consulted. Given\\nhx pilonidal cysts and concern for surrounding erythema, it was\\nthought initially that he had a pilonidal cyst with cellultis.\\nIn addition, there was a concern for abcess or fasciitis with\\nelevate CK and pain out of proportion to exam. The patient was\\nrestarted on Vanc (hx MRSA) and Flagyl (anearobic coverage). CT\\npelvis with contrast on [**6-1**] showed no concern for abscess. The\\nattending surgeon unroofed the \\\"cyst\\\" and determined that is was\\na hematoma overlying a sacral decubitous ulcer. As the patient's\\nsacral wound continued to look worse through the hospitalization\\nand as WBC count conttinued to rise, a repeat CT pevlis was\\nobtained on [**6-5**] and again there was no concern for abscess or\\nsinus tract associated with sacral deep tissue injury. Wound\\ncare nursing consult as well as plastic surgery team were\\ninvolved in care for the sacral wound. No debridement of sacral\\nwound was needed through hospitalization. On [**2193-6-14**] (day\\nprior to discharge) plastic surgery came by for final evaluation\\nand reported that the wound had \\\"a large stable eschar overlying\\nit that is dry without drainage.\\\" Recommendation was for patient\\nto be OOB as tolerated with aggressive decubitus pressure relief\\nas well as ongoing wound care with daily \\\"Critic Aid Clear\\nMoisture Barrier Ointment to perianal tissue\\\" as well as\\nfollow-up in outpatient plastic surgery clinic in [**7-1**] weeks\\nfollowing discharge from hospital.\\n\\n# Diabetes Mellitus:\\nPatient was maintained with reasonable glycemic control, most\\nvalues in mid-100s on modification and adjustment of home [**Hospital1 **]\\nNPH dosing. At discharge patient was receiving 22 units NPH at\\nbreakfast and 12 units NPH at dinner as well as humalog sliding\\nscale insulin.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nPlavix 75 mg PO daily\\nZemplar 1 mc cap given at HD\\nProtonix 40 mg PO daily\\nHumulin 70/30 40U [**Hospital1 **]\\nSensipar 30 mg PO daily\\nASA 81 PO daily\\nRenal camp 1 mg PO daily\\nFosrenol 200 mg PO daily\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly\\ndepressed (LVEF= 45 - 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and\\nfree wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the\\ndescending thoracic aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets\\ncannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely\\nthickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area\\n<0.8cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.\\nModerate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate\\n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial\\neffusion.\\n\\nPost-CPB: Patient is AV-Paced, on low dose Neo.\\nA well-seated and functioning prosthetic aortic valve is seen.\\nNo leak. No AI.
